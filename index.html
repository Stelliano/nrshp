<div class="news cms"><h1>Why the need for the NRSHP?</h1><p>The NRSHP celebrates its 10th Anniversary in June 2024. We have much to celebrate, given what 
  we have achieved thus far. The NRSHP was formed to record the proud and rich history of non-racial in the old Transvaal (now Gauteng) or the codes/members or as most would know 
  TRACOS the Transvaal Council on Sport (TRACOS). There is no doubt that the history of non-racial sport has been neglected. In many ways our history has been suppressed by the now 
  establishment sport and those that govern nationally. <br><br>
  This neglect has unfortunately created a perception in most previously white based sporting 
  codes that we (black people) never played sport. It is also disappointing that, that perception is 
  held by many journalists and administrators of sport today. It is of even more concern that some 
  of the leaders of these organisations came from the ranks of the oppressed disenfranchised 
  sports organisations or non-racial sport. They keep quite about the history because they are 
  embarrassed about the failure and total destruction of community sport as we know it. The 
  unifications that took place was a total sellout of grassroots non racial sport. The school and 
  sport policies that evolved further destroyed the very basis of community or grassroots sport.</p></div>

<div class="Feature cms"><!-- <h2>Feature Story</h2> --><p>The launch of this additional platform or portal will simply serve to ensure that we inform all 
  society of the fact that we (black people) played non-racial sport, not multi-racial or multi-national sport. SACOS was the foremost co-ordinating sports organisation that was non-partisan fighting for the expulsion of the racist sport internationally. SACOS supported all the 
  liberation movements and received the support from all of them up to the transition in the late 
  1980’s and early 1990’s when the ruling party decided to sell out the most fundamental basis of 
  developing sport. <br><br>
  Their actions is unquestionably the reason why there are no or very little sports structures in the 
  previous vibrant and active coloured/Indian/black communities. TIRFU had 14 clubs and is now 
  one club Raider RFC. Lenasia FA and Bosmont FA were the biggest football associations, now 
  neither enjoys LFA status. Lens hosted the biggest junior cricket league in the province now 
  there is nothing. There were codes like tennis, table tennis, volleyball, baseball, softball clubs, 
  chess clubs, woman and men’s hockey in all our communities. There was 6 darts associations 
  around the Transvaal Province now there is no league darts played in any of our communities in 
  Gauteng. The saddest fact is the destruction of school sport. School sport was the foundation 
  of mass participation in sport and through the various competitions and championships 
  allowed elite athletes to rise to the top and compete at a regional, provincial and national level. <br><br>
  If one scans the history content of any SASCOC or Gauteng Sports Council’s websites and their 
  codes of sports, you will find very little or no history of the TRACOS, SACOS and its members 
  history. SACOS and all its members have a rich history of not only having great athletes in, clubs 
  regions, provinces and at national level. <br><br>
  The historic SACOS Colloquium hosted by the NRSHP RSC at Wits in July 2023 clearly detailed 
  how non-racial sport was destroyed by the unity talks and the architects of the policies all 
  points to the ruling party and their comrades deployed to destroy SACOS. No Normal Sport in an 
  Abnormal Society. Sport could have played a unifying and positive tool and vehicle for change. 
  They must accept responsibility for their actions. <br><br>
  With you and these platforms we hope to change that perception and record the real and 
  factual rich history, highs, lows and struggles of non-racial sportspeople. We will tell the true 
  history of non-racial sport not only provincially but nationally too.</p></div>
