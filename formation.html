<div class="news cms"><h1>Formation</h1><p>The Non-Racial Sport History Project Gauteng was established to record the histories of the many sports people -athletes and administrators, men and women - who, in multiple ways, served Non-Racial Sport in the former Transvaal, now Gauteng. In 2013 four people namely Ajitkumar Gandabhai, Rosalie Manning Michael Kahn and Professor Noor Nieftagodien met to discuss the formation of what is now known as the Non-Racial Sport History Project. <br><br>

  After a series of meetings and workshops held at the Bosmont Football Association (BFA) offices on 31 May, 14 June and 12 July 2014 representatives from various codes of sport decided to establish a structure that would co-ordinate the project to record, preserve and publish the rich histories of non-racial sports to ensure their role in various facets of our history, including in the struggle against apartheid sport. <br><br>
  
  An objective was also expressed to actively advocate and participate in the debate to get a national project established to record the histories of all the SACOS provincial codes and the national codes that constituted the South Africa Council on Sport. In 2022 the NRSHP reached out and contacted people in all the provinces. On the 29 October 2022 the Remembering SACOS Committee was formed in Johannesburg. The NRSHP was able to get like minded people from all the provinces to meet and establish an organisation that would both develop and archive SACOS history and secondly to then celebrate the 50th anniversary of SACOS in March 2023.</p></div>

<div class="Feature cms"><p>Representatives from football, rugby, cricket, hockey, volleyball, softball, and baseball participated in the initial establishment of this NRSHP project. The participating codes has grown since that formation in 2014. <br><br>

  In pursuit of the objectives the University of the Witwatersrand (WITS) was approached. Professor Noor Nieftagodien, Head of the History Workshop, agreed to serve on the committee and generally to assist in the project. To this end, two workshops on oral history have been conducted with the aim of equipping members of the community to actively participate in recording their own histories. <br><br>
  
  The Archives at WITS (Historical Papers-William Cullen Library East Campus) has also agreed to establish an archival deposit for the project, which would include official documents, minutes, brochures, pictures and any artifacts (letters, badges, personal photos and other memorabilia) that could contribute to the creation of a rich and representative archive. <br><br>
  
  To date the Wits Historical Papers have digitised over 500 artifacts from the NRSHP. These publications and papers can be viewed on the Wits Website Direct URL http:// historicalpapers-atom.wits.ac.za/nonracial-sports-history-project-transvaal. Personal viewing the collection by appointment only, please call Wits Historical Papers 011 717 1956, to make an appointment. <br><br>
  
  The NRSHP was formally constituted on the 20 June 2015 and held its first Annual General Meeting on the 23 April 2016. The objective of developing the history of the former Transvaal which includes four provinces under today’s provincial boundaries including Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and the North-West Province. Branches were created in Pretoria, Benoni, Lenasia and centrally in Bosmont. Meetings were also held in Azaadvile on the west and with TRACOS members in the Vaal with the objective to ensure their inclusion.
